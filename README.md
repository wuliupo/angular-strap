AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of [Bootstrap 3.0+](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) into your [AngularJS 1.2+](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) app.

- With no external dependency except the [Bootstrap CSS Styles](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/css/bootstrap.css), AngularStrap is lighter and faster than ever as it does leverage the power of ngAnimate from AngularJS 1.2+!

- AngularStrap is [tested](https://travis-ci.org/mgcrea/angular-strap) against the latest patch release of the 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.5 branches.

- If you don't want to use `ngAnimate`, you will have to include a tiny [ngAnimate mock](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/wiki/ngAnimate-mock).
